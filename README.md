# General template C project

Skeleton of a C application for when I need to start new projects, just clone
this repository.

## Prerequisites

First you need to clone this repository on your machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rafaellcoellho/template-C.git
```

To analyze the code according to the linux kernel code style, the perl
checkpatch script is used. In the scripts folder use dowload.sh to download
directly from /torvalds/linux/scripts. Thanks to riboseinc who write the
[script](https://github.com/riboseinc/checkpatch).

```
$ cd scripts/
$ ./download.sh
```

The static analysis of the code is done through cppcheck. It is open source and
the repository is here in [github](https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck). If you
use ubuntu 14+ or some distro based on it, you can install using:

```
$ sudo apt-get install cppcheck
```

The tests are done with [CppUTest](https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest). You
need to run the setup-cpputest.sh script in the scripts folder. It will
download the test framework inside the project tree.

```
$ cd scripts/
$ ./setup-cpputest.sh
```

Linux already comes with the necessary programs to compile the code, gcc and make.

## Directories

- build - All files generated by the compilation are here.
- cpputest - The cpputest project, downloaded and compiled by
`setup-cpputest.sh`.
- scripts - All scripts written in shell required for the environment.
- src - Where the application goes.
- src_tests - Code in c ++ to be tested with the cpputest framework.

## Usage

The make tool tries to run all the scripts needed to build, test, and analyze
the code.

```
make analysis       -> run checkpatch and cppcheck in src
make tests          -> test plataform independent in src
make tests_coverage -> run lcov
make runnable       -> generate the executable
make clean          -> clean the proj
```

# General template C project

Skeleton of a C application for when I need to start new projects, just clone
this repository.

## Prerequisites

The tests are done with [CppUTest](https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest). You
need to run the make command. It will download the test framework inside the project tree.

```
$ make install_cpputest
```

## Directories

- build - All files generated by the compilation are here.
- cpputest - The cpputest project, downloaded and compiled by
`setup-cpputest.sh`.
- src - Where the application goes.
- src_tests - Code in c ++ to be tested with the cpputest framework.

## Usage

The make tool tries to run all the scripts needed to build, test, and analyze
the code.

```
make tests          -> test plataform independent in src
make tests_coverage -> run lcov
make bin            -> generate the executable
make clean          -> clean the proj
```
